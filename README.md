# MI Colour Theme

**MI** is specifically designed to optimize semantic highlighting for C#, C++, and Python.
While it offers effective syntax highlighting for other languages,
comprehensive testing has been concentrated on the aforementioned languages.

The dark colour scheme of **MI** draws inspirartion from the
[Monokai Accent](https://github.com/tw-studio/monokai-accent) and the
[Monokai Vibrant](https://github.com/dylantmarsh/monokai-vibrant) themes.

The light colour scheme of this theme was developed independently.
